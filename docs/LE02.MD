There's no explicit subtraction happening here. Let me clarify how this works:

The `new Date(year, month + 1, 0)` does **not** explicitly subtract 1 from the day, but rather it cleverly takes advantage of how the `Date` constructor works.

### Here's how it works in detail:

- **`new Date(year, month + 1, 0)`** creates a date for the **last day of the previous month**.
  - `year` is the year you are interested in (e.g., 2025).
  - `month + 1` is the next month (since months are zero-indexed, `0` is January, `1` is February, etc.).
  - `0` as the day is special in JavaScript's `Date` constructor. It tells JavaScript to set the day to the **last day of the previous month**.

### Example with **March 2025**:
If you're calculating for March 2025, where `month` is `2` (because JavaScript months are zero-indexed), this line will be:
```javascript
new Date(2025, 3, 0);
```
- This creates a date for **March 1st, 2025** (because we're asking for the "0th day" of March, which effectively means the last day of February).

Then, calling `.getDate()` on that will return `28` for **February 2025** (since February 2025 has 28 days).

### Important Note:
- There is **no subtraction** happening in the code itself. The `0` for the day in the `new Date(year, month + 1, 0)` call is what results in the last day of the previous month, and that's how we calculate the number of days in the current month.

### `daysInMonth = new Date(year, month + 1, 0).getDate();`

1. **`new Date(year, month + 1, 0)`**
   - This creates a `Date` object representing the **last day of the previous month**.
     - The `new Date(year, month + 1, 0)` expression works as follows:
       - `year` is the year for the calendar (e.g., 2025).
       - `month + 1` is the next month (since `Date` objects are 0-indexed, meaning `January` is `0`, `February` is `1`, etc.). By adding `1` to the `month`, we're specifying the next month.
       - `0` represents the "0th day" of that month, which means we want the **last day of the previous month**.

   So, if we're calculating for **March 2025** (where `month` is `2`), this will create a date for **March 1st, 2025**, and subtracting `1` from the day will result in **February 28th** (since February has 28 days in 2025).

2. **`.getDate()`**
   - This method returns the day of the month from the `Date` object.
   - So, calling `.getDate()` on the `new Date(year, month + 1, 0)` will return the **last day of the previous month**. This is essentially the total number of days in the current month.
   - For **March 2025**, it will return `31` because February 2025 ends on the 28th, and March starts on the 1st.

### Example:
- For **March 2025**, this line will return `31`, because March has 31 days.

### `const firstDay = new Date(year, month, 1).getDay();`

1. **`new Date(year, month, 1)`**
   - This creates a `Date` object for the **first day of the current month**.
     - `year` is the year (e.g., 2025).
     - `month` is the current month (for example, 2 for March).
     - `1` is the 1st day of the month.

   So, for **March 2025**, this will create a date for **March 1st, 2025**.

2. **`.getDay()`**
   - This method returns the day of the week as a number:
     - `0` for Sunday, `1` for Monday, ..., `6` for Saturday.
   - Calling `.getDay()` on a `Date` object gives us which weekday the 1st of the month falls on.
   
   For **March 1st, 2025**, it will return `6`, because March 1st, 2025 is a **Saturday**.

### Example:
- For **March 2025**, this line will return `6` because March 1st, 2025 is a Saturday.

### Summary:
- `daysInMonth` calculates how many days are in the month by using the last day of the previous month.
- `firstDay` calculates which day of the week the 1st of the month falls on (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.).

These two pieces of information (`daysInMonth` and `firstDay`) are used to properly populate the calendar with the correct number of days and to align the days correctly with their respective weekdays (e.g., ensuring the 1st of the month starts on the correct weekday).
