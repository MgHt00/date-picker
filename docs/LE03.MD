Here's a breakdown of the `generateCalendar()` function:

### Overview
The `generateCalendar()` function is designed to dynamically generate a calendar for a specific month and year, and then append it to a `calendarContainer` element. The function does this in several steps, breaking down the task into smaller, reusable functions (helper functions) for different parts of the calendar, such as the header, grid, and blank spaces.

### Main Steps

1. **Clear Existing Calendar Content:**
   ```javascript
   calendarContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear any existing calendar content
   ```
   This ensures that the calendar is completely refreshed each time the function runs.

2. **Calculate Days in Month and First Day of the Month:**
   ```javascript
   const daysInMonth = new Date(year, month + 1, 0).getDate();
   const firstDay = new Date(year, month, 1).getDay();
   ```
   - `daysInMonth` calculates the total number of days in the month by creating a new `Date` object for the first day of the next month (`month + 1`) and subtracting 1 day (`0`) to get the last day of the current month.
   - `firstDay` calculates which day of the week the 1st day of the month falls on (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.).

3. **Create the Header for Days of the Week:**
   ```javascript
   const headerRow = createDaysOfWeekHeader();
   calendarContainer.appendChild(appendDaysOfWeekToHeader(headerRow));
   ```
   - `createDaysOfWeekHeader()` creates a `div` element to serve as the header for the calendar (the row displaying the days of the week).
   - `appendDaysOfWeekToHeader()` populates the header row with individual day names (`Sun`, `Mon`, `Tue`, etc.), and appends this row to the container.

4. **Create the Grid for the Days of the Month:**
   ```javascript
   const daysGrid = createDaysGrid();
   appendBlankSpacesBeforeFirstDay(daysGrid, firstDay);
   appendMonthDaysToGrid(daysGrid, daysInMonth);
   calendarContainer.appendChild(daysGrid);
   ```
   - `createDaysGrid()` creates the main grid (`div`) that will hold all the day cells.
   - `appendBlankSpacesBeforeFirstDay()` adds empty `div` elements to account for any days before the 1st of the month (based on `firstDay`).
   - `appendMonthDaysToGrid()` adds the actual days of the month to the grid (from 1 to `daysInMonth`).
   - Finally, the completed grid is appended to the `calendarContainer`.

### Helper Functions

1. **createDaysOfWeekHeader():**
   Creates and returns the header row element that will contain the days of the week.

2. **appendDaysOfWeekToHeader(headerRow):**
   Iterates over an array of weekday names (`['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']`), creates a `div` for each day, and appends it to the header row.

3. **createDaysGrid():**
   Creates and returns the grid container element (`div`) where the days of the month will be placed.

4. **appendBlankSpacesBeforeFirstDay(daysGrid, firstDay):**
   Adds empty `div` elements to the grid for any days before the 1st of the month (e.g., if the 1st is a Wednesday, it will add 3 empty spaces for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday).

5. **appendMonthDaysToGrid(daysGrid, daysInMonth):**
   Adds `div` elements for each day of the month (from `1` to `daysInMonth`), filling the grid with the days.
