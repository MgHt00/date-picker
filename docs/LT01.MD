Sure, let's break down the regular expression used for validating an HTML tag name: 

```javascript
const validTagPattern = /^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$/;
```

### Breakdown:

1. **`^`**: This asserts the start of the string. It ensures that the pattern matches from the beginning of the input.

2. **`[a-zA-Z]`**: This character set matches any uppercase (`A-Z`) or lowercase (`a-z`) letter. It's used here to ensure that the tag name starts with a letter.

3. **`[a-zA-Z0-9-]*`**:
   - **`[a-zA-Z0-9-]`**: This character set matches any letter (`a-zA-Z`), digit (`0-9`), or hyphen (`-`). 
   - **`*`**: This quantifier means "zero or more" of the preceding character set. It allows the tag name to have zero or more additional characters after the initial letter, as long as they are letters, digits, or hyphens.

4. **`$`**: This asserts the end of the string. It ensures that the pattern matches until the end of the input.

### What It Does:
- The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$` checks if the input:
  - Starts with a letter.
  - Is followed by zero or more letters, digits, or hyphens.
  - Ends at the last character of the string.

### Example Matches:
- Valid: `div`, `span`, `h1`, `my-custom-tag`
- Invalid: `1tag` (starts with a digit), `-tag` (starts with a hyphen), `tag!` (contains an invalid character `!`).
